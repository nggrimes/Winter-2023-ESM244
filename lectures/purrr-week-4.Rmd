# Purrr

---

# Data science relies on computer iterating power

We couldn't do what we do without the computer doing things thousands to millions of times, really fast

For loops are useful tools, but have limitations

- Doesn't integrate into tidyverse very well

- Difficult to interpret

- Nesting is confusing

- One error breaks the whole process

- Can be slow if not constructred properly

R is a functional (i.e we use functions to get stuff done) language, why not use a functional iterative process?

# Introducing mapping with purrr

```{r,out.width="20%",fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2d0701b616efa7435cd5a94e703baa595a4f9ed0/d41b9/css/images/hex/purrr.png")
```




.cbig[
```{r,eval=FALSE}
map(.x,  # What are we evaluating or passing through to a function?
    .f,  # The function itself
    ...  # Extra features for the function or mapping options
    )
```
]

### Because the first element is data or information, map works really well in pipes
---

# Quickly apply functions to all columns of data

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  map(mean)%>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_classic()
```

### Map returns the results as a list

- You've encountered lists before. Regression outputs, ggplots, etc. are all stored as lists in R. They are the most flexible storage object followed by tibbles.

---

# Easy to change how map returns output using map_\* where \* is an abbreviation for any object

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  map_dbl(mean) %>%  # dbl is short for double e.g numbers
  head() %>% kable() %>%
  kable_classic()
```


### [Checkout the cheatsheet for all the information](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/purrr.pdf)

???
 Why not just use built in functions like summarize, col_means, etc.? 
 
 Less code, easier, and map can use any function that we make for complex tasks
 
---

# We can use or design any function to accomplish our tasks

### Imagine you are tasked with running regressions over subsets of data each with different regressions specifications how would you do it?

```{r,eval=FALSE}
mod1=lm(y~x,data=filter(thing1,df))
mod2=lm(y~x,data=filter(thing2,df))
....
```

### Map can apply regressions to any number of subsets

```{r,results=FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  split(mtcars$cyl) %>%   #split is a base R so not part of the tidyverse
  map(~lm(mpg~wt,data = .)) # the . is passed from the pipe with .x of map
```

### Only 3 cylinders in the dataset, but there could have been 1,000 and the code above would store 1,000 regression models

---

# Map can loop over multiple lists of data simultaneously with map2 and pmap

```{r,eval=FALSE}
map2(.x,  # dataset 1
     .y,  # dataset 2
     .f(x,y,...),  # the function the accepts dataset1 and dataset2 
     ...
     )
```

```{r}
by_cyl <- mtcars %>%  split(mtcars$cyl)  # Store the dataset for predictions

mods <- by_cyl %>%  map(~lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .))

predictions<-map2(mods, by_cyl, predict) # Take my linear mods and use the data to predict mpg
```



### pmap lets us put in any number of inputs as a list

---

# Like For Loops, map requires careful thought to make sure everything works

1. What am I trying to accomplish?

2. How is my data currently stored?

3. How will my data be passed to map?

4. Build (or use) a function that accepts everything

### I've used map to iterate bioeconomic models over 100,000s of parameter combinations, and run machine learning algorithms on 1000s of datasets

### Beyond this class you will encounter big datasets, purrr is the best way to handle enourmous dataframes

# Extra fun things

---

# map can catch errors 

1. Won't break the entire process so you have to start again. Nothing hurts more than running code for hours to get an error at the end.

2. You know what models ran into errors in the future

`safely()` and `possibly()` store errors and allow you to return errors respectively
.csmall[
```{r}
# Make up some data
dat = structure(list(group = c("a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b"), 
                     x = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "A", "A", "A"), 
                     y = c(10.9, 11.1, 10.5, 9.7, 10.5, 10.9, 13, 9.9, 10.3)), 
                class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -9L))

#Define safe lm function
safelm=safely(.f=lm)

dat %>% 
  split(dat$group) %>%
  map(~safelm(y~x,data=.x)) %>% 
  map("error") # Pull out errors
  

```
]

# Sets up parallel processing!

The furrr package allows you to access your computer or server's multiple cores

Speeds everything up exponentially

Works just like purrr map, but sends blocks of data to your computers other cores

.pull-left[
```{r}
library(tictoc)
library(furrr)

plan(sequential)

#Run code to pause the computer for two seconds
tic()
test_slow<-future_map(c(2,2,2),~Sys.sleep(.x))
toc()

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
#tell the computer we want to use three of our cores
plan(multisession,workers=3)

#Start a timer then run code to pause the computer for 2 seconds
tic()
test_fast<-future_map(c(2,2,2),~Sys.sleep(.x))
toc()
```

]

# Progess bars

Tired of waiting for code to run and you have no idea how long it will take?

purrr comes with built in progress bars to see how long its taking

```{r}
library(purrr)
x<-map(1:50,\(x) Sys.sleep(0.1),
       .progress=TRUE)
# Notice I used an anonymous function
```
